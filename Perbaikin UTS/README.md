### Chapter 3: Unsupervised Learning
- **Focus**: Applied unsupervised techniques like PCA and k-Means clustering.
- **Implementation**:
  - Reduced dimensionality of the Iris dataset using PCA.
  - Visualized clusters formed by k-Means.
  - Evaluated clustering using silhouette scores.

### Chapter 4: Feature Engineering
- **Focus**: Demonstrated preprocessing techniques and feature selection.
- **Implementation**:
  - Standardized features.
  - Created polynomial features.
  - Used SelectKBest to identify top features for classification.

### Chapter 5: Model Evaluation and Improvement
- **Focus**: Improved model performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Implementation**:
  - Used GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters.
  - Evaluated models with confusion matrices and classification reports.
